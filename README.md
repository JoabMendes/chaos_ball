# Chaos Ball Game

# The Concept

This is a game slightly akin to Pinball or Breakout. The player will be in an arena. Each of the 
four corners will have a color, and four balls with corresponding colors will be floating around. 
Amid the four colored balls, there will be several yellow balls, called chaos balls. 
Chaos balls exist solely to get in your way and make the game challenging! They are smaller than the four 
colored balls, but they also move faster. Players will have a flat surface with which they will 
attempt to knock the colored balls into the correct corners.
